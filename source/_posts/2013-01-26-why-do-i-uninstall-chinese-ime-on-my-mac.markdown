I uninstalled all Chinese IMEs on my Mac a few days ago for the following reasons:

1. Having multiple IMEs was annoying - especially when I was coding. Countless times I typed a few commands in the console only to find they were some meaningless Chinese words. Then I had to switch to English IME and type them in again.

2. Without the ability of typing Chinese I have to use English more. My Chinese is basically flawless and does not require any more practise (if I don't want to become a writer). On the other hand, my English isn't. (You can probably tell from this post :p)

3. This is the most important point: to write in English require much more focus and energy for me. Thus, I tend to write only when absolutely necessary, and write as little as possible. I spent a lot of time on different forums (and on twitter of course) arguing with people who really do not worth my precious seconds. Now I am not able to do it anymore (well... not actually *unable* but I probably wouldn't bother) even if I want to. How wonderful is that?

Hope I can keep make wise decisions like this one :D
