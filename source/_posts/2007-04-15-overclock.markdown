One reason (and quite important one) I chose Conroe E6300 is that it can be overclocked a lot...well, if lucky enough. The origin frequency is 1.86G (266*7) and my target is 400*7 at least. Thanks to the super motherboard Asus Commando and the Corsair DDRII 800 memory I hit that frequency right away without any difficulty. 

However the temperature was not satisfied as the beginning -- 65C idle. And the motherboard automatically raised the voltage as well. So I tried to lock the CPU core voltage at 1.2V which is lower than the default number and lock the voltage of FSB Terminate and NB Vcore to there default value as well. Still running at 400*7, the processor passed all pressure tests and is always under 50C. Very good result. And obviously it can be raised to higher frequency. But for safety let&#39;s just keep it for now -- more than enough for me anyway.
